# IoMBian Shutdown Handler

This service listens to a "long_click" event from a ZeroMQ publisher and shuts down the device.


## Installation

- Define project name in an environment variable:

> ```PROJECT_NAME=iombian-shutdown-handler```

- Clone the repo into a temp folder:

> ```git clone https://github.com/Tknika/${PROJECT_NAME}.git /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME} && cd /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME}```

- Create the installation folder and move the appropiate files (edit the user):

> ```sudo mkdir /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp requirements.txt /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp -r src/* /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp systemd/${PROJECT_NAME}.service /etc/systemd/system/```

> ```sudo chown -R iompi:iompi /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

- Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

> ```cd /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```python3 -m venv venv```

> ```source venv/bin/activate```

> ```pip install --upgrade pip```

> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Start the script

> ```sudo systemctl enable ${PROJECT_NAME}.service && sudo systemctl start ${PROJECT_NAME}.service```

## Docker

To build the docker image, from the cloned repository, execute the docker build command in the same level as the Dockerfile.

```docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION} .```

For example:
```docker build -t iombian-shutdown-handler:latest .```

After building the image, execute it with docker run.

```docker run --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} --privileged --rm -d -v /run/systemd/system:/run/systemd/system -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket -v /bin/systemctl:/bin/systemctl -e SHUTDOWN_EVENT=triple_click```

- --name is used to define the name of the created container.

- --privileged is for granting privileges to the docker container. This is needed because the iombian-button-handler needs to create a thread to listen to the button events.

- --rm can be used to delete the container when it stops. This parameter is optional.

- -d is used to run the container detached. This way the container will run in the background. This parameter is optional.

- -v is used to pass a volume to the container.
In this case it's used to give the container acces to some files.
This volumes are necessary so the container can shut down the host machine.

- -e can be used to define the environment variables:
    - BUTTON_EVENTS_HOST: the host where the button events will be published.
    Default value is the localhost 127.0.0.1.
    - BUTTON_EVENTS_PORT: the port where the button events will be published.
    Default value is 5556.
    - SHUTDOWN_EVENT: the received event that will trigger the shutdown.
    Default event is long_click.
    - LOG_LEVEL: define the log level for the python logger.
    This can be NOTSET, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL.
    Default value is INFO.
